Headlines included "Ilhan Omar again accuses Jews of 'allegiance to a foreign country'" (New York Post) and "Omar faces blowback after comments on Israel and 'allegiance to a foreign country'" (CNN). Democratic leadership and Jewish organizations criticized the remarks as invoking antisemitic dual loyalty tropes.

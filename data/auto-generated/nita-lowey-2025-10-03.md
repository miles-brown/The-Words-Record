### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 11 May 2021

- **Context:** During the May 2021 escalation of violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Representative Lowey issued a statement addressing the conflict. This came as Hamas fired hundreds of rockets into Israel and Israel responded with airstrikes on Gaza. The 11-day conflict resulted in over 200 Palestinian deaths and 12 Israeli deaths. As a senior Jewish-American congresswoman and longtime supporter of U.S. aid to Israel, Lowey's statement was part of broader congressional responses to the crisis.
- **Platform:** Official congressional statement/press release
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** The statement received minimal individual coverage as it aligned with mainstream Democratic positions supporting Israel's right to self-defense while expressing concern for civilian casualties. Jewish publications noted her balanced approach typical of pro-Israel Democrats during the conflict.
- **Categories:** Politics / Foreign Policy / Israel-Palestine / Congressional Statement / Conflict Response
- **Response / Outcome:** No follow-up response was required as the statement was well within mainstream Democratic Party positions on Israel-Palestine issues.
- **Repercussions:**
  - Lost Employment: NO
  - Lost Contracts: NO
  - Painted Negatively: NO
  - Details: No repercussions occurred; the statement was considered standard diplomatic language for a pro-Israel Democrat.

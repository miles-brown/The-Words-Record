- **Biography:** Marcelo Freixo was born in Rio de Janeiro and began his career as an educator and academic, teaching philosophy and history. He became politically active through his work on human rights issues, particularly focusing on police violence and militia activities in Rio de Janeiro's favelas. His academic background and activism naturally led him into politics as a means to effect systemic change.

Freixo gained national prominence as a state deputy when he led the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry (CPI) into militias operating in Rio de Janeiro from 2008-2009. This work exposed the deep connections between paramilitary groups, politicians, and police, making him a target for death threats but also establishing him as a leading voice on public security reform. His courage in confronting powerful criminal organizations earned him widespread respect among human rights advocates.

Currently serving as a Federal Deputy, Freixo has been a consistent advocate for progressive causes including racial equality, LGBTQ+ rights, environmental protection, and criminal justice reform. He ran unsuccessful campaigns for mayor of Rio de Janeiro in 2012 and 2016, and for governor of Rio de Janeiro state in 2018 and 2022, positioning himself as an anti-corruption candidate focused on human rights and social justice.

Throughout his political career, Freixo has maintained his academic connections and continues to be a vocal critic of authoritarian tendencies in Brazilian politics. His work has consistently focused on defending democratic institutions and marginalized communities against violence and oppression.

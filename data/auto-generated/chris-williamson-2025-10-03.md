### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 23 February 2019
- **Exact Wording:** *"We've backed off far too much, we've given too much ground, we've been too apologetic... We've done more to address the scourge of antisemitism than any political party."*
- **Context:** Williamson made these comments at a meeting in Sheffield defending Labour's handling of antisemitism allegations. He argued that the Labour Party had been "too apologetic" about antisemitism complaints and suggested the party had been unfairly criticized. This came during a period of intense scrutiny over Labour's handling of antisemitism cases under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.
- **Platform:** Public meeting/speech in Sheffield
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported this as controversial, with headlines focusing on his "too apologetic" comment. The BBC, Guardian, and other outlets framed it as inflammatory during a sensitive period for Labour on antisemitism. Jewish groups and Labour MPs condemned the remarks as tone-deaf and inappropriate.
- **Categories:** Politics / Antisemitism / Party Discipline / Public Speaking / Controversy
- **Response / Outcome:** Williamson was suspended from the Labour Party the following day. He initially refused to apologize, then later issued a clarification. He was readmitted to Labour in June 2019 but suspended again the same day after making further comments. He eventually had the Labour whip permanently removed and sits as an independent.

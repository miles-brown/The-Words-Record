She was discovered by American record producer Evan Rogers in 2003 and moved to the United States to pursue a recording career. Her debut album "Music of the Sun" was released in 2005, launching one of the most successful music careers of the 21st century. With over 250 million records sold worldwide, she became one of the best-selling music artists of all time, earning 14 number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100.

Beyond music, Rihanna has built a business empire, launching Fenty Beauty in 2017 with a focus on inclusivity across all skin tones, revolutionizing the cosmetics industry. Her Savage X Fenty lingerie brand has similarly emphasized body positivity and diversity. In 2022, she was named a billionaire by Forbes, largely due to her business ventures. She was also appointed as an Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary by the Barbadian government in 2018.

Rihanna has been selective with political statements throughout her career, occasionally speaking out on issues like racial justice, gun violence, and humanitarian crises. She established the Clara Lionel Foundation in 2012, focusing on global education, emergency response programs, and climate resilience. In 2022, she performed at the Super Bowl halftime show while pregnant with her second child, and has largely stepped back from music to focus on business and family.

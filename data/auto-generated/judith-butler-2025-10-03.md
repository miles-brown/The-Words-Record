Butler's groundbreaking 1990 book "Gender Trouble" challenged traditional notions of gender and sex, arguing that gender is performative rather than innate, revolutionizing feminist and queer theory. The work established Butler as one of the most influential philosophers of the late 20th century. Butler has held prestigious academic positions and continues to write extensively on gender, sexuality, ethics, and political theory.

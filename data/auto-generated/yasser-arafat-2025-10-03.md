Arafat became chairman of the PLO in 1969 and led the Palestinian national movement for over three decades. He initially advocated for armed resistance against Israel but later pursued diplomatic solutions, culminating in the Oslo Accords signed with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1993. For this peace initiative, he shared the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize with Rabin and Shimon Peres. However, the peace process ultimately failed, and the Second Intifada erupted in 2000.

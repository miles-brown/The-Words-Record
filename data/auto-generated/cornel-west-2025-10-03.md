- **Biography:** Cornel West was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and raised in Sacramento, California. He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1973 and earned his PhD in philosophy from Princeton University in 1980. West became one of America's most prominent public intellectuals, known for his synthesis of Christian theology, Marxist analysis, and democratic ideals in addressing issues of race, class, and social justice.

West has held prestigious academic positions at Harvard University, Princeton University, and Union Theological Seminary. He has authored numerous influential books including "Race Matters" (1993), which became a bestseller and established him as a leading voice on racial issues in America. His work combines philosophical rigor with accessible public engagement, making complex ideas about democracy, justice, and equality available to broad audiences.

Throughout his career, West has been a vocal critic of both conservative and liberal policies, particularly those he views as perpetuating economic inequality and racial injustice. He has been involved in various social movements and has frequently appeared in media as a commentator on political and social issues. In 2023, he announced his candidacy for President of the United States as an independent candidate, running on a platform of economic justice, anti-imperialism, and democratic renewal.

West has been known for taking controversial stances on various issues, including sharp criticism of Israeli policies toward Palestinians, American foreign policy, and what he sees as the Democratic Party's abandonment of progressive principles. His willingness to challenge establishment positions across the political spectrum has made him both a respected voice for many progressives and a polarizing figure in mainstream political discourse.

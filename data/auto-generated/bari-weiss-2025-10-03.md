- **Biography:** Bari Weiss was born in Pittsburgh to a Jewish family and grew up attending Tree of Life synagogue, which later became the site of the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history. She studied at Columbia University where she became involved in pro-Israel activism and co-founded Columbians for Academic Freedom in response to what she saw as anti-Israel bias in Middle Eastern studies departments. After graduation, she worked at various publications including The Wall Street Journal before joining The New York Times as an opinion writer and editor in 2017. During her time at the Times, she wrote extensively about antisemitism, cancel culture, and intellectual freedom, often taking positions that put her at odds with progressive colleagues. In July 2020, she resigned from the Times in a widely publicized resignation letter, citing harassment and discrimination from colleagues who disagreed with her views. She subsequently founded The Free Press (originally called Common Sense), an independent media company focused on investigative journalism and commentary. Weiss has authored several books and continues to be a prominent voice in debates about free speech, antisemitism, and political polarization.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 7 October 2023
- **Exact Wording:** *"What we witnessed this weekend was the largest mass killing of Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas is a genocidal terrorist organization. There is no justification—none—for the slaughter of families, for the rape of women, for the kidnapping of children, for the massacre of people at a music festival. Anyone who tells you otherwise, anyone who tells you that this was 'resistance' is a morally bankrupt person."*
- **Context:** Following Hamas's surprise attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed over 1,200 people and took hundreds hostage, Bari Weiss posted a series of statements on social media condemning the attacks and criticizing those who justified them as resistance. The attack marked the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust and sparked a war between Israel and Hamas.

- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets covered Weiss's statements as part of broader coverage of public figures' responses to the October 7 attacks.

- **Categories:** Terrorism / Antisemitism / Israel-Palestine Conflict / Social Media / International Relations

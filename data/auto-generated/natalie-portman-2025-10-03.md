The $2 million prize honors individuals for their professional achievements and commitment to Jewish values. However, in April 2018, Portman announced through her representatives that she would not attend the ceremony due to "recent events in Israel" and her desire not to appear as endorsing Prime Minister Netanyahu, who was scheduled to speak at the event.

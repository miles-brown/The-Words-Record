### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 12 May 2021

Blackford was responding as SNP Westminster Leader during a period when many UK politicians were making statements about the situation.
- **Platform:** Twitter
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** The statement was part of broader political responses to the 2021 Gaza conflict, with various UK politicians taking positions. Scottish media outlets reported on SNP's stance, which was generally more critical of Israeli actions than the UK government's position. The statement aligned with SNP's generally pro-Palestinian foreign policy positions.
- **Categories:** Politics / International Relations / Social Media / Human Rights / Middle East
- **Response / Outcome:** The statement was consistent with SNP policy and received support from pro-Palestinian groups. Blackford continued to advocate for stronger UK government action on Palestinian rights throughout the conflict period.

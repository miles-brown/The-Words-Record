She became involved in the civil rights movement while attending Spelman College and later Sarah Lawrence College, where she began writing. Her early works focused on the African American experience, particularly that of Black women in the South.

Walker's literary career flourished with novels like "Meridian" (1976) and "The Color Purple" (1982), the latter becoming her most famous work and earning her both the Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award. The novel was later adapted into a successful film by Steven Spielberg and a Broadway musical. She coined the term "womanism" as an alternative to feminism that specifically addressed the experiences of women of color.

Throughout her career, Walker has been an outspoken activist on various issues including civil rights, women's rights, and international conflicts. She has written extensively on political topics and has been involved in numerous humanitarian causes. Her activism extends to issues in Africa, where she has worked on campaigns against female genital mutilation.

Walker has faced controversy for her political positions, particularly regarding Israel and Palestine, and for endorsing books that have been criticized as antisemitic. Despite controversies, she remains an influential voice in American literature and progressive activism, continuing to write and speak on social justice issues into her later years.

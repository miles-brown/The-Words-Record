- **Biography:** Norman Gary Finkelstein was born in Brooklyn to Holocaust survivors. His parents were both survivors of the Warsaw Ghetto and Nazi concentration camps. He grew up hearing firsthand accounts of the Holocaust, which profoundly shaped his worldview and later academic work.

Finkelstein earned his PhD in political science from Princeton University in 1988. His academic career has been marked by controversy due to his sharp criticism of Israeli policies and his critique of what he calls "the Holocaust industry" - the exploitation of Holocaust memory for political and financial gain. He has taught at various universities including Brooklyn College, Hunter College, and DePaul University, though his tenure case at DePaul was denied amid significant controversy.

His most notable works include "The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering" (2000) and "Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History" (2005). These books have made him a polarizing figure in academic and political circles. He has been a vocal critic of Israeli policies toward Palestinians and has supported the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement.

Finkelstein continues to write, lecture, and engage in political activism. He maintains that his criticism of Israel stems from his commitment to human rights and his Jewish upbringing, arguing that the lessons of the Holocaust should inspire protection of all oppressed peoples, including Palestinians.

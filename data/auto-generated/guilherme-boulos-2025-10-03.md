- **Biography:** Guilherme Castro Boulos was born into a middle-class family in São Paulo and studied philosophy at the University of São Paulo. He became politically active during university, initially involved in student movements before transitioning to housing rights activism. In 2004, he co-founded and became the national coordinator of the Homeless Workers' Movement (MTST), which became Brazil's largest homeless movement under his leadership, organizing land occupations and fighting for affordable housing.

Boulos rose to national prominence through his activism and political campaigns. He ran for mayor of São Paulo in 2016 and 2020, finishing second in the runoff both times. In 2018, he was the PSOL candidate for President of Brazil, receiving over 600,000 votes. His political platform focuses on housing rights, urban reform, and progressive social policies. He was elected as a Federal Deputy for São Paulo in 2022, representing PSOL in the National Congress.

Throughout his career, Boulos has been a vocal critic of neoliberal policies and has advocated for wealth redistribution and social justice. He has written several books on urban policy and social movements. His work has made him one of Brazil's most recognizable left-wing politicians, though he has also faced criticism and legal challenges related to his activism and land occupation activities.

Boulos is known for his articulate defense of progressive causes and has become a prominent voice in Brazilian left-wing politics, particularly on issues of housing, inequality, and social justice.

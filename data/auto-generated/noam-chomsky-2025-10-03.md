- **Biography:** Noam Chomsky was born in Philadelphia to Jewish immigrant parents and grew up speaking Hebrew. He developed an early interest in radical politics and linguistics, earning his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1955. His doctoral work revolutionized the field of linguistics with his theory of generative grammar, fundamentally changing how language acquisition is understood.

Chomsky joined MIT in 1955, where he became Institute Professor and developed his groundbreaking theories about universal grammar and the innate nature of language learning. His academic work earned him recognition as one of the most cited living scholars. However, he gained equal prominence as a political activist and critic, beginning with his opposition to the Vietnam War in the 1960s.

Since the 1960s, Chomsky has been a prolific author of political works, writing over 100 books criticizing U.S. foreign policy, media manipulation, and corporate power. His works like "Manufacturing Consent" and "Hegemony or Survival" have been highly influential in leftist political circles worldwide. He has consistently advocated for libertarian socialist principles and has been a vocal critic of both capitalism and state socialism.

Throughout his career, Chomsky has been involved in numerous political causes, from anti-war activism to supporting various international solidarity movements. Despite his criticism of Israeli policies, he has faced accusations of antisemitism from some quarters while also being criticized by others for not being sufficiently anti-Zionist.

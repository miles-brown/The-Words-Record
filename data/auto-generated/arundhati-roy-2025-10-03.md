Her debut novel "The God of Small Things" (1997) won the Booker Prize, making her the first non-expatriate Indian woman to win the award. The novel's success brought her international recognition and financial independence, which she leveraged to become a prominent political activist.

Since the late 1990s, Roy has become one of India's most vocal critics of government policies, particularly regarding environmental destruction, nuclear weapons, and economic inequality. She has written extensively against large dam projects, corporate globalization, and Hindu nationalism. Her political essays, collected in books like "The Cost of Living" and "Walking with the Comrades," have made her a controversial figure in India. She has faced legal challenges and criticism from various quarters for her outspoken views.

Roy continues to write both fiction and non-fiction, with her second novel "The Ministry of Utmost Happiness" published in 2017 after a 20-year gap. She remains an active voice in global political discourse, speaking on issues of social justice, environmental rights, and anti-imperialism. Her work has been translated into numerous languages and she continues to be a significant figure in contemporary Indian literature and activism.

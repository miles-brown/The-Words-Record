- **Biography:** Ilan Pappé was born in Haifa to German Jewish parents who immigrated to Israel. He grew up in a Zionist household and served in the Israeli military before pursuing academic studies. He earned his PhD from Oxford University in 1984 and began his career as a historian at the University of Haifa, where he taught for over two decades.

Pappé's academic work focuses on the modern history of the Middle East, particularly the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He became increasingly critical of Israeli policies and Zionist historiography throughout his career, transitioning from a Zionist to a post-Zionist and eventually anti-Zionist position. His most famous work, "The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine" (2006), argues that Israeli forces systematically expelled Palestinians during the 1948 war as part of a deliberate plan.

Due to his controversial positions and support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, Pappé faced significant criticism and pressure in Israel. In 2007, he left Israel to take up a position at the University of Exeter in the UK, where he currently serves as Professor of History and Director of the European Centre for Palestine Studies. He continues to be a prolific writer and speaker on Palestinian issues.

Pappé's work has been both praised by Palestinian rights advocates and severely criticized by mainstream Israeli historians and supporters of Israel, who accuse him of distorting historical facts to fit his political agenda. Despite the controversy, he remains an influential voice in debates about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has authored over 20 books on Middle Eastern history and politics.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 11 July 2000
- **Exact Wording:** *"I think there is a chance for peace. I think Ehud Barak has shown real courage, and I think Chairman Arafat has a chance to make a decision for peace that could give the Palestinian people what they deserve - a chance to live in their own state, on their own land, in dignity."*
- **Context:** President Clinton made this statement during the Camp David Summit, a critical two-week peace negotiation between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat. Clinton was hosting and mediating the talks at the presidential retreat, attempting to broker a comprehensive peace agreement between Israelis and Palestinians. The summit ultimately failed to produce an agreement, with both sides unable to reach consensus on key issues including Jerusalem, refugee return, and borders.
- **Platform:** Press conference at Camp David
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets covered Clinton's optimistic statements during the summit, though coverage later focused on the failure to reach an agreement. The New York Times reported on Clinton's efforts to mediate between the parties, while other outlets highlighted the challenges in bridging the gaps between Israeli and Palestinian positions.
- **Categories:** Politics / Diplomacy / International Relations / Middle East Peace Process
- **Response / Outcome:** Clinton continued his mediation efforts throughout the summit. After the talks collapsed, he later presented the Clinton Parameters in December 2000, outlining his proposed framework for a final peace settlement. Clinton maintained that both sides made progress but couldn't bridge final gaps.

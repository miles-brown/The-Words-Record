### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 11 July 2000
- **Exact Wording:** *"I think we can get an agreement. Both sides have now acknowledged they can't get everything they want. Both sides have acknowledged they have to make some painful compromises."*
- **Context:** President Clinton was hosting the Camp David Summit between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, attempting to broker a comprehensive peace agreement to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This was one of the most significant diplomatic efforts of Clinton's presidency, with intensive negotiations lasting from July 11-25, 2000. Clinton made this statement during the summit as he tried to mediate between the two sides on core issues including Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Israeli settlements, and borders.
- **Platform:** Press briefing during Camp David Summit
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major media outlets covered the summit extensively as a historic peace effort. Headlines focused on Clinton's role as mediator and the unprecedented level of detail being discussed. The New York Times, Washington Post, and other outlets portrayed Clinton as an engaged broker trying to bridge seemingly insurmountable gaps between the parties.
- **Categories:** Politics / Diplomacy / International Relations / Peace Process / Middle East
- **Response / Outcome:** The Camp David Summit ultimately failed to produce an agreement, with Clinton later blaming Arafat's rejection of the proposals. Clinton continued peace efforts through his final days in office, including the Clinton Parameters presented in December 2000.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 22 July 2024
- **Exact Wording:** *"Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters. What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third, or fourth time. We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering, and I will not be silent."*
- **Context:** Vice President Harris delivered these remarks after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House during his visit to Washington. The meeting occurred amid ongoing conflict in Gaza following the October 7, 2023 Hamas attacks and Israel's military response. Harris spoke to reporters after their private meeting, addressing both Israel's security concerns and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
- **Platform:** White House press availability/interview with reporters
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported this as Harris taking a notably more critical tone toward Israel's conduct in Gaza compared to President Biden's typical statements. CNN described it as Harris being "more forceful" in criticizing Israel's actions. The New York Times characterized her comments as reflecting "growing Democratic concerns" about civilian casualties. Conservative outlets noted the shift in tone, while some progressive outlets praised her for acknowledging Palestinian suffering more explicitly.

- **Response / Outcome:** Harris's office later clarified that her position remained aligned with the Biden administration's overall Israel policy, emphasizing both Israel's right to self-defense and concern for civilian casualties.

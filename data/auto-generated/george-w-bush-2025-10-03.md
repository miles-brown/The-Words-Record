### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 24 June 2002
- **Exact Wording:** *"I call on the Palestinian people to elect new leaders, leaders not compromised by terror. I call upon them to build a practicing democracy, based on tolerance and liberty. If the Palestinian people actively pursue these goals, America and the world will actively support their efforts."*
- **Context:** President Bush delivered a major policy speech in the Rose Garden outlining his vision for Middle East peace. This was the first time a U.S. president explicitly called for Palestinian statehood while simultaneously demanding new Palestinian leadership and an end to terrorism. The speech came during the Second Intifada and following numerous suicide bombings against Israeli civilians.
- **Platform:** White House Rose Garden speech
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported this as a significant shift in U.S. Middle East policy. The New York Times called it "Bush's Vision." CNN reported it as "Bush calls for Palestinian state." Arab leaders and Palestinians criticized the conditions placed on statehood, while Israeli officials were mixed in their response. International media focused on both the historic nature of supporting Palestinian statehood and the controversial demand for leadership change.
- **Categories:** Politics / Foreign Policy / Middle East / Diplomacy / Presidential Speech
- **Response / Outcome:** Bush continued to advocate for the two-state solution throughout his presidency, including supporting the Road Map for Peace in 2003 and hosting the Annapolis Conference in 2007. He maintained his position that Palestinian leadership needed to renounce terrorism.

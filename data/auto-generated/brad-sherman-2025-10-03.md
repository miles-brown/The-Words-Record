### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 11 May 2021

- **Context:** Sherman made this statement during a significant escalation of violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza in May 2021. The conflict began after tensions in Jerusalem over evictions in Sheikh Jarrah and clashes at Al-Aqsa Mosque. Hamas launched rockets toward Israel, and Israel responded with airstrikes on Gaza. Sherman's statement came as many members of Congress were being pressed to take positions on the conflict.
- **Platform:** Twitter
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Sherman's statement was typical of many mainstream Democratic politicians who affirmed Israel's right to self-defense while calling for de-escalation. His position was noted as being more moderate than some progressive Democrats who were more critical of Israel's actions. The statement received relatively little individual media attention as it aligned with the Democratic Party mainstream position at the time.
- **Categories:** Politics / Foreign Policy / Middle East / Congressional Statement / Israel-Palestine
- **Response / Outcome:** Sherman did not issue any clarifications or apologies for this statement, as it was consistent with his longstanding support for Israel and aligned with his party's mainstream position.

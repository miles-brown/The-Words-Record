### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 29 October 2020
- **Exact Wording:** *"The scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media. That combination hurt Jewish people and must never be repeated."*
- **Context:** Corbyn made this statement in response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report that found the Labour Party under his leadership had unlawfully harassed and discriminated against Jewish people. The EHRC investigation was prompted by complaints about antisemitism within the party during Corbyn's tenure as leader. His statement was seen as disputing the scale of antisemitism issues within Labour.
- **Platform:** Facebook post and public statement
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported this as Corbyn refusing to fully accept the EHRC findings. The BBC reported "Jeremy Corbyn suspended from Labour over anti-Semitism report response." The Guardian headline read "Jeremy Corbyn suspended from Labour after his response to antisemitism report." Most coverage focused on his suggestion that the problem was "overstated" and the immediate suspension that followed.
- **Categories:** Politics / Antisemitism / Party Leadership / Legal / Social Media
- **Response / Outcome:** Corbyn was immediately suspended from the Labour Party by current leader Keir Starmer. The Labour whip was withdrawn, meaning he could not sit as a Labour MP. Corbyn later attempted to clarify his remarks but was not readmitted to the parliamentary party, leading to his eventual departure from Labour in 2024.

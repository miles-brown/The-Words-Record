### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 30 October 2020
- **Exact Wording:** *"The scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media."*
- **Context:** Jeremy Corbyn made this statement in response to the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) report that found the Labour Party had unlawfully harassed and discriminated against Jewish people under his leadership. The report concluded there had been serious failings in leadership and inadequate processes for handling antisemitism complaints during Corbyn's tenure as party leader.
- **Platform:** Facebook post and public statement
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported extensively on Corbyn's response, with many framing it as him downplaying the antisemitism findings. Headlines included "Jeremy Corbyn suspended from Labour Party over response to antisemitism report" (BBC) and "Corbyn suspended after saying antisemitism claims were 'overstated'" (Guardian). Most coverage emphasized that his comments contradicted the EHRC findings.
- **Categories:** Politics / Antisemitism / Party Leadership / Legal Findings / Media Response
- **Response / Outcome:** Corbyn was immediately suspended from the Labour Party following his statement. He later attempted to clarify his remarks, saying he regretted the pain caused to the Jewish community, but maintained his original position about political exaggeration of the issue.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 23 April 2023
- **Exact Wording:** *"It is true that many types of white people with points of difference, such as redheads, can experience this prejudice. But they are not all their lives subject to racism. Jewish, Irish and Traveller people all suffer from 'racism'. This is similar to racism and the two words are often used as if they are interchangeable."*
- **Context:** Abbott wrote a letter to The Observer newspaper responding to an article about racism. In her letter, she appeared to suggest that Jewish, Irish and Traveller people experience prejudice and discrimination but not racism in the same way as Black people. The letter was published and immediately sparked controversy for appearing to minimize antisemitism and create a hierarchy of racism.
- **Platform:** The Observer newspaper (letter to editor)
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported this as a significant controversy. Headlines included "Diane Abbott suspended from Labour Party over racism letter" and focused on her apparent distinction between racism and prejudice. The coverage was largely critical, with Jewish organizations and politicians from multiple parties condemning the comments as deeply offensive and historically ignorant.
- **Categories:** Politics / Antisemitism / Media / Party Discipline / Race Relations
- **Response / Outcome:** Abbott issued a public apology stating the letter was an "initial draft" sent by mistake and that she wished to "wholly and unreservedly withdraw my remarks and disassociate myself from them." She acknowledged the letter was offensive and wrong.
- **Repercussions:**
  - Lost Employment: NO - Though suspended from Labour Party, retained MP position
  - Lost Contracts: NO
  - Painted Negatively: YES - Widely criticized across political spectrum and media
  - Details: Suspended from Labour Party parliamentary group pending investigation. Faced calls for resignation from multiple Jewish organizations and cross-party politicians.

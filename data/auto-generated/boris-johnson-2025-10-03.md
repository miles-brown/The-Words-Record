### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 12 May 2021
- **Exact Wording:** *"I urge all parties to step back from the brink and for the government of Israel to cease settlement activity which is illegal under international law."*
- **Context:** During escalating violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Boris Johnson made this statement as Prime Minister calling for de-escalation. The comment was part of a broader statement condemning rocket attacks from Gaza while also criticizing Israeli settlement activities in the West Bank. This represented a more balanced position than some previous UK government statements, explicitly calling Israeli settlements "illegal under international law."
- **Platform:** Official government statement/Press conference
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** The statement was widely reported as showing a more even-handed approach to the conflict. The Guardian noted it as a shift toward criticizing Israeli policy, while The Times highlighted the dual condemnation of both Hamas rockets and Israeli settlements. Jewish Chronicle reported mixed reactions from Jewish community leaders.
- **Categories:** Politics / International Relations / Diplomacy / Middle East Policy
- **Response / Outcome:** Johnson faced criticism from some Conservative MPs who felt the statement was too critical of Israel, while others praised the balanced approach. The Israeli government did not directly respond to Johnson's specific comments, but continued its operations in Gaza.

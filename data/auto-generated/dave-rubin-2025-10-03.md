He began his career as a stand-up comedian and later worked as a progressive political commentator, co-hosting "The Young Turks" from 2013-2015. During this period, he was aligned with left-wing politics and supported progressive causes.

Rubin launched "The Rubin Report" in 2015, initially as a progressive show, but gradually shifted toward classical liberal and libertarian positions. He became known for hosting long-form conversations with guests across the political spectrum, though he increasingly featured conservative voices. His ideological evolution became a central part of his public persona, often describing himself as someone who "didn't leave the left, the left left me."

Rubin has written books including "Don't Burn This Book" (2020) and has been associated with various media organizations including Blaze Media. He is openly gay and married to his husband David Janet, with whom he has children through surrogacy. His shift from progressive to conservative-leaning positions has made him a controversial figure, with critics arguing he has abandoned his principles for financial gain.

He frequently discusses issues related to free speech, cancel culture, and what he perceives as the authoritarian tendencies of the progressive left. His commentary often focuses on defending classical liberal values and criticizing identity politics.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 14 May 2021

- **Context:** Clyburn issued this statement during the May 2021 escalation of violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The conflict began after tensions in Jerusalem, particularly around the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood and Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, led to rocket attacks from Gaza and Israeli airstrikes. Clyburn was responding to calls for congressional leaders to address the civilian casualties, particularly children, during the 11-day conflict.
- **Platform:** Official congressional statement
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** The statement was reported by various outlets as representing a more nuanced position than some Democrats, acknowledging Israel's right to self-defense while expressing concern about civilian casualties. It was seen as part of growing Democratic criticism of Israeli actions during the conflict.
- **Categories:** Politics / Foreign Policy / Congressional Statement / Israel-Palestine Conflict
- **Response / Outcome:** Clyburn continued to call for de-escalation and eventually supported the ceasefire that was reached on 21 May 2021. He has maintained his position supporting Israel's security while expressing concern about civilian casualties.

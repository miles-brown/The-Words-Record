### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 16 January 2009
- **Exact Wording:** *"I'm not going to say that what Israel is doing is necessarily wrong, but I think what they're doing is disproportionate... You know what, there are many people who are Arab who live peacefully and are doctors and lawyers, and there are people who are Arab who are in Hamas who want to kill Jews. In the same respect, there are Jews who want to live peacefully, and there are Jews who have, as part of their ideology, that they must reclaim all of Eretz Israel. So I think painting everyone with that same brush is probably the thing that continues to add to the conflict there."*
- **Context:** During Israel's military operation in Gaza (Operation Cast Lead, December 2008 - January 2009), Stewart addressed the conflict on The Daily Show. The three-week military operation resulted in significant casualties and international debate about proportionality and civilian deaths. Stewart was responding to the ongoing violence and international criticism of Israel's military response to Hamas rocket attacks.

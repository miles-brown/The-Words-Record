### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 22 May 2017
- **Exact Wording:** *"22 dead - number rising. Schofield. Don't you even dare. Do not be part of the problem. We need a final solution"*
- **Context:** This tweet was posted by Hopkins in the immediate aftermath of the Manchester Arena bombing on 22 May 2017, which killed 22 people and injured many more. The attack occurred after an Ariana Grande concert and was carried out by a suicide bomber. Hopkins appeared to be responding to what she perceived as insufficient responses to terrorism, though the specific reference to "Schofield" was unclear. The phrase "final solution" is historically associated with Nazi Germany's plan for the genocide of European Jews.
- **Platform:** Twitter
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported extensively on the tweet, with most focusing on the use of Nazi terminology. Headlines included "Katie Hopkins uses Nazi phrase 'final solution' in tweet about Manchester attack" (The Guardian) and similar coverage emphasizing the historical connotations of the phrase. Most coverage was critical, noting the inappropriate nature of using Holocaust terminology.
- **Categories:** Social Media / Terrorism / Holocaust References / Public Safety / Politics
- **Response / Outcome:** Hopkins deleted the tweet and claimed it was an "awful" auto-correct error, saying she meant to write "true solution." However, many questioned this explanation given the context and her history of controversial statements.
- **Repercussions:**
  - Lost Employment: YES - LBC Radio ended her contract shortly after this incident
  - Lost Contracts: YES - Various media opportunities were reportedly withdrawn
  - Painted Negatively: YES - Widespread negative media coverage and public condemnation
  - Details: LBC terminated her contract, citing the tweet as the reason. She faced widespread criticism from politicians, public figures, and the general public for using Nazi terminology.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 3 April 2019
- **Exact Wording:** *"Brazil is a Christian country and I can be a friend to Israel."*
- **Context:** During his first year as President of Brazil, Bolsonaro made this statement as part of his broader diplomatic outreach to Israel. This occurred in the context of his administration's significant shift in Brazil's Middle East policy, moving away from the traditionally more balanced approach of previous governments toward stronger support for Israel. The statement came during discussions about potentially moving Brazil's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, following the U.S. embassy move in 2018.
- **Platform:** Public speech/statement to media
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** International media covered this as part of Bolsonaro's broader pro-Israel stance and shift in Brazilian foreign policy. Headlines focused on the diplomatic realignment and the potential embassy move. Coverage was generally factual, noting the departure from Brazil's historical position.
- **Categories:** Politics / International Relations / Diplomacy / Religion / Foreign Policy
- **Response / Outcome:** Bolsonaro continued to strengthen ties with Israel throughout his presidency, though he ultimately did not move the embassy to Jerusalem due to domestic agricultural lobby concerns about Arab market access.
- **Repercussions:**
  - Lost Employment: NO
  - Lost Contracts: NO
  - Painted Negatively: NO
  - Details: This statement was generally well-received by his evangelical Christian base and pro-Israel supporters, though it did raise some concerns among Arab-Brazilian communities and traditional diplomats.

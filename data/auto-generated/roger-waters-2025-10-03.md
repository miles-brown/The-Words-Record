He became the band's primary creative force behind concept albums like "The Dark Side of the Moon," "Wish You Were Here," "Animals," and "The Wall." His father died in World War II when Waters was an infant, which influenced much of his later anti-war sentiment and lyrical themes.

After leaving Pink Floyd in 1985, Waters pursued a solo career and became increasingly involved in political activism. He has been a vocal critic of various military interventions and has used his platform to advocate for human rights causes. His political views have often been incorporated into his music and public performances, making him one of rock music's most politically outspoken figures.

Waters continues to tour and record music while maintaining his activism. His work often addresses themes of war, politics, and social justice. He has been particularly vocal about Middle Eastern conflicts and has used his concerts as platforms for political messaging, sometimes generating significant controversy.

His outspoken political positions, particularly regarding Israel and Palestine, have led to both support from activist communities and criticism from various groups. Despite controversies, he remains an influential figure in both music and political activism, continuing to tour internationally and speak on issues he considers important.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 17 May 2023
- **Exact Wording:** *"The musician performed in Berlin wearing a leather coat reminiscent of Nazi SS uniforms, displayed Anne Frank's name alongside other victims on a large screen, and fired a fake machine gun into the audience during 'In The Flesh' as part of his 'The Wall' tour production."*
- **Context:** During his performance of "The Wall" in Berlin, Waters wore what appeared to be a Nazi-style leather coat and performed scenes that critics said evoked fascist imagery. The performance included a segment where he fired a fake machine gun while names of people he considered victims of oppression appeared on screen, including Anne Frank. This was part of his long-running rock opera "The Wall," which is intended as an anti-fascist, anti-war piece, but the imagery and context in Berlin proved particularly controversial.
- **Platform:** Live concert performance in Berlin
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported the incident as controversial and potentially antisemitic. German police investigated whether the performance violated laws against incitement. Headlines focused on the Nazi imagery and the inclusion of Anne Frank's name. Some outlets noted Waters' claims that the performance was anti-Nazi satire, while others emphasized Jewish community outrage.
- **Categories:** Entertainment / Politics / Antisemitism / Germany / Historical Sensitivity
- **Response / Outcome:** Waters defended the performance as anti-fascist art and satire, stating it was meant to condemn totalitarianism. He accused critics of misunderstanding the artistic intent and claimed he was being unfairly targeted for his political views on Israel-Palestine.

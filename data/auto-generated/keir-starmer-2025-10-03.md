### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 12 October 2023
- **Exact Wording:** *"Israel does have that right" [to cut off power and water to Gaza]. "Israel has that right of self-defence."*
- **Context:** Following Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, Starmer was interviewed on LBC Radio where he was asked about Israel's response, including cutting off power and water supplies to Gaza. His comments were made in the context of discussing Israel's right to self-defence following the unprecedented terrorist attack that killed over 1,400 Israelis.
- **Platform:** LBC Radio interview with Nick Ferrari
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** The comments generated significant controversy and internal Labour Party criticism. Major outlets reported widespread anger from Labour MPs, councillors, and members. The Guardian, BBC, and Sky News covered the backlash extensively, with headlines focusing on "fury" and "anger" within the Labour Party. Some interpreted his comments as endorsing collective punishment of Palestinians.
- **Categories:** Politics / International Relations / Party Leadership / Middle East Policy / Media Interview
- **Response / Outcome:** Starmer later clarified his position, stating he was referring to Israel's right to self-defence generally, not specifically endorsing cutting off utilities. Despite calls for his resignation from some Labour members and councillors, he retained his position as party leader but faced ongoing internal pressure over his Israel-Palestine stance.

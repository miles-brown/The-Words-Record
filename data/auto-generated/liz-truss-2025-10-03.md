- **Media Coverage / Framing:** The statement was reported straightforwardly by major UK outlets as reflecting the government's official position. The Guardian, BBC, and Sky News covered it as part of the UK's diplomatic response to the conflict, with some noting criticism from pro-Palestinian groups about the lack of condemnation of Israeli actions in Gaza.

- **Response / Outcome:** Truss maintained this position throughout her tenure as Foreign Secretary and continued to express support for Israel's security during subsequent statements. The UK government faced some criticism from opposition MPs and advocacy groups for not calling for restraint from both sides equally.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 14 May 2021
- **Exact Wording:** *"The United States must stop enabling Netanyahu's war crimes. We must condition aid to Israel on respecting human rights and stopping the expansion of settlements."*
- **Context:** During the May 2021 escalation of violence between Israel and Hamas, Bowman was among the progressive House Democrats who called for conditioning U.S. military aid to Israel. This came amid Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and rocket attacks from Hamas, with significant civilian casualties on both sides. Bowman joined other Squad members in criticizing Israeli actions and U.S. support.
- **Platform:** Twitter
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported on progressive Democrats' criticism of Israel during the conflict. The New York Times and CNN covered the divide within the Democratic Party, with progressives like Bowman calling for conditioning aid while moderate Democrats supported traditional U.S.-Israel policy. Jewish publications and pro-Israel groups criticized the statements, while progressive outlets praised the calls for accountability.
- **Categories:** Politics / Foreign Policy / Human Rights / Social Media / Congressional Relations
- **Response / Outcome:** Bowman continued to advocate for conditioning military aid to Israel throughout his tenure. His positions on Israel became a significant factor in his 2024 primary loss to George Latimer, who was heavily supported by pro-Israel groups including AIPAC. The race became one of the most expensive House primaries in history, with Israel policy as a central issue.

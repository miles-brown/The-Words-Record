### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 14 March 2024
- **Exact Wording:** *"I believe in his heart, his highest priority is the security of Israel. However, I also believe Prime Minister Netanyahu has lost his way by allowing his political survival to take precedence over the best interests of Israel. Netanyahu won't commit to a military operation in Rafah that prioritizes protecting civilian life. Netanyahu won't commit to a post-Gaza war plan that includes a revitalized Palestinian Authority and a path to a Palestinian state. At this critical juncture, I believe a new election is the only way to allow for a healthy and open decision-making process about the future of Israel."*
- **Context:** Schumer delivered a major speech on the Senate floor calling for new elections in Israel and criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the Gaza war. This came amid mounting tensions between the Biden administration and Netanyahu over the conduct of the war and civilian casualties in Gaza. Schumer, the highest-ranking Jewish official in the U.S. government, faced pressure from both progressive Democrats and Jewish communities over U.S. support for Israel during the conflict.
- **Platform:** U.S. Senate Floor Speech
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major news outlets characterized this as an unprecedented rebuke of Netanyahu by the highest-ranking Jewish American official.

- **Categories:** Politics / International Relations / Middle East / Jewish Affairs / Legislative

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** April 2016
- **Exact Wording:** *"Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States. Problem solved!"* (shared Facebook post with map showing Israel relocated to United States)
- **Context:** In April 2016, it was revealed that Naz Shah had shared a Facebook post in 2014 (before becoming an MP) suggesting Israel should be "relocated" to the United States as a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The post included a map and was originally created by someone else. She also shared other posts including one comparing Israeli policies to those of Hitler. These posts came to light during increased scrutiny of antisemitism within the Labour Party.
- **Platform:** Facebook
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported this as part of broader Labour antisemitism concerns. Headlines included "Labour MP Naz Shah suspended over Israel Facebook posts" (BBC) and coverage focused on whether the posts constituted antisemitism. The story was framed within the context of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership and growing concerns about antisemitism in Labour.
- **Categories:** Politics / Social Media / Antisemitism / Israel-Palestine
- **Response / Outcome:** Shah was suspended from the Labour Party in April 2016. She issued a full apology, stating the posts were "deeply offensive" and that she had been "ignorant" about their implications. She underwent educational sessions with Jewish community leaders and was readmitted to the party in July 2016. She has since become an advocate against antisemitism and regularly engages with Jewish community groups.

Colbert attended Northwestern University, where he studied theater and began performing with improvisational comedy groups.

Colbert's career began with The Second City comedy troupe in Chicago before joining "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" as a correspondent in 1997. His satirical character as a right-wing pundit became so popular that Comedy Central gave him his own show, "The Colbert Report," which ran from 2005 to 2014. The show earned critical acclaim and multiple Emmy Awards for its brilliant parody of cable news punditry.

In 2015, Colbert transitioned to mainstream late-night television as the host of "The Late Show" on CBS, replacing David Letterman. He dropped his satirical conservative persona and became more openly liberal in his political commentary. Under his hosting, the show has covered major political events and social issues, often featuring serious discussions alongside comedy segments.

Colbert is known for his Catholic faith, liberal political views, and sharp political satire. He has been vocal about various social and political issues throughout his career, using his platform to address topics ranging from politics to social justice, while maintaining his comedic approach to serious subjects.

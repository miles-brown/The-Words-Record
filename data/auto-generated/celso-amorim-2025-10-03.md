He rose through the ranks of Brazil's foreign service, serving in various international postings including Geneva, London, and Washington. His diplomatic career spans over five decades, during which he became one of Brazil's most prominent international voices.

Amorim served as Brazil's Foreign Minister twice - first under President Itamar Franco (1993-1995) and later under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003-2011). During his tenure under Lula, he was instrumental in developing Brazil's foreign policy toward South-South cooperation, strengthening ties with other emerging economies through BRICS, and positioning Brazil as a leader in Latin American integration. He played key roles in nuclear negotiations with Iran and Turkey, and advocated for reform of international institutions like the UN Security Council.

After leaving the Foreign Ministry, Amorim continued his academic and diplomatic work, serving as Defense Minister under President Dilma Rousseff (2011-2015). He has written extensively on international relations and Brazilian foreign policy. In 2023, he returned to government as Chief Foreign Policy Advisor to President Lula da Silva, continuing to shape Brazil's international engagement and promoting multilateralism and South-South cooperation.

Throughout his career, Amorim has been known for his advocacy of Palestinian rights and criticism of Israeli policies, reflecting Brazil's traditional support for Palestinian statehood and adherence to international law in the Middle East conflict.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 6 December 2017
- **Exact Wording:** *"I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today, I am delivering."*
- **Context:** President Trump announced his decision to formally recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, breaking with decades of U.S. policy. This decision fulfilled a campaign promise and implemented the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which previous presidents had repeatedly waived.
- **Platform:** White House Diplomatic Reception Room speech
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported this as a historic shift in U.S. Middle East policy. CNN called it "Trump's Jerusalem gamble," while Fox News framed it as "Trump delivers on promise." International media largely focused on concerns about regional stability, with BBC reporting "widespread condemnation" from Arab leaders and European allies expressing concern about undermining peace prospects.
- **Categories:** Politics / International Relations / Middle East Policy / Presidential Decision / Religious Sites
- **Response / Outcome:** Trump defended the decision as long overdue and stated it would advance peace prospects. The embassy move was completed in May 2018. He continued to advocate for the policy throughout his presidency.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 12 May 2021

- **Context:** Caroline Lucas made this statement on Twitter during the May 2021 escalation of violence between Israel and Hamas, following tensions over evictions in Sheikh Jarrah, Jerusalem, and clashes at Al-Aqsa Mosque. The 11-day conflict resulted in over 250 deaths, mostly Palestinian civilians including children.

- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Lucas's statement was part of broader international calls for de-escalation during the conflict. Her balanced approach calling for recognition of both Israeli and Palestinian human rights was consistent with many UK political figures' responses, though she was more explicitly critical of civilian casualties than some colleagues.
- **Categories:** Politics / International Relations / Human Rights / Social Media / Middle East
- **Response / Outcome:** The statement was consistent with her party's position on Palestinian rights and received support from Green Party supporters. No controversy or retraction followed.

- **Biography:** Naomi Klein was born in Montreal to a Jewish family and grew up in a politically engaged household. Her mother was a feminist filmmaker and her grandfather was an animator. She attended the University of Toronto but dropped out to pursue journalism. Klein rose to prominence with her 1999 book "No Logo," which became a foundational text of the anti-globalization movement, critiquing how multinational corporations use branding to dominate culture and politics.

Klein continued her critique of capitalism with "The Shock Doctrine" (2007), which argues that free-market policies are often implemented during times of crisis when populations are too disoriented to resist. She has also written extensively about climate change in "This Changes Everything" (2014), arguing that addressing climate crisis requires fundamental changes to the economic system. Her work consistently connects environmental, economic, and social justice issues.

As a journalist and activist, Klein has been a prominent voice in progressive movements for over two decades. She has held academic positions at Rutgers University and is a frequent commentator on political and economic issues. Her work has been translated into numerous languages and she has received various awards for her contributions to social justice discourse.

Klein has been particularly vocal about issues related to Israel-Palestine, drawing connections between her anti-corporate activism and criticism of Israeli policies. She has faced both praise and criticism for her positions on Middle East politics, which she frames within her broader critique of militarism and corporate power.

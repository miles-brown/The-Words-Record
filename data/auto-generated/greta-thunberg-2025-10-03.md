At age 11, she stopped talking and eating, leading to her diagnosis with Asperger syndrome, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and selective mutism.

In August 2018, at age 15, Thunberg began skipping school to protest outside the Swedish Parliament, holding a sign reading "School Strike for Climate." This action sparked the global "Fridays for Future" movement, with millions of students worldwide joining climate strikes. Her activism gained international attention, leading to speeches at the UN Climate Action Summit and other global forums.

Thunberg has become one of the world's most recognized climate activists, known for her direct, uncompromising rhetoric about climate change. She has received numerous awards and honors, including being named Time magazine's Person of the Year in 2019 at age 16. Her activism extends beyond climate issues to various social justice causes.

She has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, which she refers to as her "superpower," and has been open about how it affects her worldview and activism. Thunberg continues to be a prominent voice in climate activism and frequently speaks out on various global issues through social media and public appearances.

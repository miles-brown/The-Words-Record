- **Biography:** Edward Said was born in Jerusalem in 1935 to a Palestinian Christian family and moved to the United States for his education. He became one of the most influential literary critics and public intellectuals of the late 20th century, earning his PhD from Harvard and teaching at Columbia University for decades. His groundbreaking work "Orientalism" fundamentally changed how Western scholarship approached the study of the Middle East and colonial subjects, arguing that Western representations of the Orient were tools of imperial domination.

Said was equally known for his political activism on behalf of Palestinian rights. He served on the Palestinian National Council from 1977 to 1991 and was a close advisor to Yasser Arafat, though he later became critical of the PLO leadership and the Oslo Accords. He advocated for a secular, democratic one-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and was a fierce critic of both Israeli policies and Arab authoritarianism.

Throughout his career, Said faced criticism from various quarters - pro-Israeli groups attacked his political positions while some Palestinian activists criticized his secular approach and eventual break with Arafat. He continued writing and speaking on both literary and political topics until his death from leukemia in 2003, leaving behind a complex legacy as both a pioneering academic and controversial political figure.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 23 May 2021
- **Exact Wording:** *"Israel has a right to defend itself and its people. The Palestinian people's legitimate aspirations for dignity, opportunity, and a homeland must also be respected. Democrat and Republican Members of Congress are united in our commitment to eliminating any and all anti-Semitism, in the United States and around the world. Now, after more than a week of hostilities, it has become even more apparent that a ceasefire is necessary."*
- **Context:** This statement was issued during the May 2021 escalation of violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, following tensions in Jerusalem over evictions in Sheikh Jarrah and clashes at Al-Aqsa Mosque. Pelosi was responding to increased pressure from progressive Democrats to take a more critical stance toward Israel while balancing traditional Democratic Party support for Israel.

- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported this as Pelosi attempting to balance competing pressures within the Democratic Party. CNN described it as "carefully worded" while acknowledging both Israeli security concerns and Palestinian rights. The New York Times noted it represented a shift toward more balanced language compared to traditional Democratic statements that focused primarily on Israeli security.

- **Response / Outcome:** Pelosi continued to face pressure from progressive Democrats for stronger criticism of Israel, while also receiving criticism from pro-Israel groups for not being sufficiently supportive. She maintained this balanced approach throughout her remaining tenure as Speaker.

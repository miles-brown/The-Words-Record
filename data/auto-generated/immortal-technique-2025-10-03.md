His breakthrough came with his independently released albums "Revolutionary Volume 1" (2001) and "Revolutionary Volume 2" (2003), which established him as one of the most politically outspoken artists in hip-hop. Unlike many mainstream rappers, he has deliberately avoided major record label deals to maintain creative control and political independence. His lyrics often incorporate detailed political analysis and historical references, making him popular among activists and politically conscious listeners.

Beyond music, Immortal Technique has been involved in various activist causes, including organizing benefit concerts for causes in Afghanistan and supporting indigenous rights movements. He frequently speaks at universities and political events, using his platform to promote anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist messages.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 7 November 2017
- **Exact Wording:** *"The UK remains steadfast in our commitment to Israel's security. We will continue to defend Israel's right to defend itself."*
- **Context:** During her tenure as International Development Secretary, Priti Patel was discovered to have held 12 undisclosed meetings with Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during what was supposed to be a family holiday in August 2017. She also met with Israeli officials in New York and London without informing the Foreign Office. During these meetings, she discussed potential UK aid funding for Israeli army medical units treating wounded Syrians in the Golan Heights. This violated the Ministerial Code, which requires ministers to clear foreign meetings through the Foreign Office.
- **Platform:** Government meetings and subsequent parliamentary statements
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported this as a significant breach of protocol. Headlines included "Priti Patel faces calls to quit over secret Israel meetings" (BBC) and "Priti Patel quits as international development secretary after Netanyahu meeting row" (Guardian). The coverage focused on the constitutional impropriety and questions about divided loyalties.
- **Categories:** Politics / Diplomatic Protocol / Government Ethics / Israel Relations / Ministerial Conduct
- **Response / Outcome:** Patel initially defended her actions and expressed support for Israel's security. However, facing mounting pressure and after it emerged she had also met with Israeli officials without telling Downing Street, she resigned from her cabinet position on 8 November 2017.

  - Lost Employment: YES - She resigned as International Development Secretary
  - Lost Contracts: NO
  - Painted Negatively: YES - Extensive negative coverage about breaching ministerial protocols

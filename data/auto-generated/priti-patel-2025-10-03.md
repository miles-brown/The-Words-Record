### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 2 November 2017
- **Exact Wording:** *"The UK has maintained its longstanding position that Israeli settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territories is illegal under international law, presents an obstacle to peace, and threatens the viability of the two-state solution."*
- **Context:** This statement was made during a parliamentary written answer while Patel was International Development Secretary. However, this came amid significant controversy over Patel's unauthorized meetings with Israeli officials during what was supposed to be a family holiday in August 2017. She had met with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and other officials without informing the Foreign Office, leading to questions about her conduct and ultimately her resignation from the Cabinet on 8 November 2017.
- **Platform:** Parliamentary written answer
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets focused heavily on the unauthorized Israel meetings scandal rather than this specific parliamentary answer. Headlines included "Priti Patel resigns over Israel meetings row" (BBC) and "Priti Patel's Israel meetings: Timeline of a scandal" (Guardian). The meetings were seen as potentially undermining UK foreign policy.
- **Categories:** Politics / Diplomacy / Government / Middle East / Parliamentary
- **Response / Outcome:** Patel was forced to resign from her Cabinet position as International Development Secretary on 8 November 2017 due to the unauthorized meetings scandal, though she maintained she had done nothing wrong.

Their 1973 album "The Dark Side of the Moon" remained on the Billboard charts for 14 years and is considered one of the greatest albums ever made. The band experienced significant internal tensions, particularly between Waters and Gilmour, leading to Waters' departure in 1985. Despite legal battles over the band name, Pink Floyd continued with Gilmour as the primary creative force. Roger Waters, the band's primary lyricist during their classic period, has become increasingly outspoken on political issues in recent decades, particularly regarding human rights and international conflicts. His political activism has sometimes overshadowed his musical legacy and created controversy within the band's fanbase.

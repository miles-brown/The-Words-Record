### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 29 July 2012
- **Exact Wording:** *"It is a deeply moving experience to be in Jerusalem, the capital of Israel"*
- **Context:** During his 2012 presidential campaign, Romney made a controversial statement at a fundraising breakfast in Jerusalem explicitly recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. This occurred at a time when U.S. policy deliberately avoided taking a position on Jerusalem's status due to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Romney also praised Israeli economic achievements and suggested cultural factors contributed to the economic disparity between Israelis and Palestinians, which drew criticism from Palestinian officials.
- **Platform:** Public fundraising event in Jerusalem
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported the statement as a significant departure from traditional U.S. diplomatic positions. Headlines focused on Romney "breaking with U.S. policy" and the potential diplomatic implications. Palestinian officials criticized the remarks as showing bias, while Israeli officials welcomed them. Media coverage noted this was part of Romney's broader effort to distinguish his foreign policy positions from President Obama's.
- **Categories:** Politics / International Relations / Presidential Campaign / Middle East Policy
- **Response / Outcome:** Romney's campaign later clarified that his position was consistent with recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital while supporting a two-state solution. Romney did not apologize for the statement and maintained his pro-Israel positions throughout the campaign.
- **Repercussions:**
  - Lost Employment: NO
  - Lost Contracts: NO
  - Painted Negatively: YES
  - Details: Romney faced criticism from Palestinian officials and some diplomatic experts for the Jerusalem statement, though he was praised by pro-Israel groups. The controversy was part of broader scrutiny of his foreign policy positions during the campaign.

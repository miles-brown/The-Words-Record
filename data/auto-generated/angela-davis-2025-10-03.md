- **Biography:** Angela Davis was born in Birmingham, Alabama, during the height of segregation and grew up witnessing the civil rights struggles of the South. She excelled academically, studying at Brandeis University and later pursuing graduate work in philosophy at UC San Diego under Herbert Marcuse. Her early exposure to Marxist philosophy and the Black Panther movement shaped her radical political consciousness.

Davis became internationally known in 1970 when she was placed on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list in connection with a courtroom shooting in Marin County, California. Though she maintained her innocence, she spent 16 months in jail before being acquitted of all charges in 1972. The "Free Angela Davis" campaign became a global cause célèbre, making her one of the most recognizable faces of 1970s radicalism.

After her acquittal, Davis continued her academic career while remaining a prominent activist. She earned her doctorate in philosophy and became a professor, eventually joining UC Santa Cruz where she helped establish the feminist studies department. Her scholarship has focused on feminism, racism, and the prison system, with her book "Are Prisons Obsolete?" becoming influential in prison abolition movements.

Davis has remained active in various progressive causes throughout her career, speaking out on issues ranging from police brutality to international solidarity movements. Her positions often align with anti-imperialist and pro-Palestinian perspectives, consistent with her broader leftist political framework and her longstanding criticism of what she views as oppressive state structures.

- **Context:** The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute announced it would rescind the Fred Shuttlesworth Human Rights Award that was to be given to Angela Davis after receiving complaints about her support for the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel and her criticism of Israeli policies toward Palestinians.

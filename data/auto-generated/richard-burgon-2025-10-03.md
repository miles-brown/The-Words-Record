### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:

Various outlets noted how left-wing Labour MPs were balancing condemnation of Hamas with criticism of Israeli actions, reflecting ongoing divisions within the party on Israel-Palestine issues.

- **Response / Outcome:** Burgon maintained his position throughout the subsequent conflict, continuing to call for ceasefires and criticizing both Hamas attacks and Israeli military responses. No retraction or apology was made.

- **Biography:** Malala Yousafzai was born in Mingora, Swat Valley, Pakistan, to educator Ziauddin Yousafzai and Toor Pekai Yousafzai. She began advocating for girls' education at age 11 when she wrote a blog for the BBC Urdu service under a pseudonym about life under Taliban occupation in her region. Her activism made her a target, and on 9 October 2012, a Taliban gunman shot her in the head while she was riding a school bus.

After recovering from her injuries in the United Kingdom, Malala continued her education advocacy on a global scale. She co-founded the Malala Fund with her father in 2013 to champion girls' education worldwide. In 2014, at age 17, she became the youngest person ever to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, sharing it with Indian children's rights activist Kailash Satyarthi. She graduated from Oxford University in 2020 with a degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics.

Malala has authored several books, including her memoir "I Am Malala" and has produced content for various media platforms. She serves as a UN Messenger of Peace and continues to advocate for education access, particularly for girls in conflict zones and developing countries. Her work extends beyond education to broader human rights issues, though she generally focuses on non-political humanitarian causes.

She has generally maintained a focus on education and human rights issues rather than taking explicit political stances on geopolitical conflicts, preferring to emphasize universal human rights principles and the importance of education and dialogue in resolving global challenges.

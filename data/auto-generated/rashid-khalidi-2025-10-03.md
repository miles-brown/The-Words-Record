- **Biography:** Rashid Khalidi was born in 1948 in New York City to a prominent Palestinian family. His father was a diplomat and his family has deep roots in Jerusalem. He grew up in a multilingual household and developed an early interest in Middle Eastern history and politics. Khalidi received his BA from Yale University in 1970 and his DPhil from Oxford University in 1974.

Khalidi began his academic career teaching at the American University of Beirut from 1976 to 1983, during which time he also served as a press liaison for the Palestine Liberation Organization during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. He later taught at Georgetown University and the University of Chicago before joining Columbia University in 2003 as the Edward Said Professor of Modern Arab Studies. He has authored numerous influential books including "Palestinian Identity," "The Iron Cage," and "The Hundred Years' War on Palestine."

Khalidi is currently one of the most prominent Palestinian-American academics and public intellectuals. He regularly appears in media discussing Middle Eastern affairs and has been a vocal critic of Israeli policies toward Palestinians. His scholarship focuses on Palestinian history, the origins of Arab nationalism, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. He has been influential in shaping academic discourse on these topics.

Throughout his career, Khalidi has been a controversial figure due to his criticism of Israeli policies and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. His past association with the PLO and his critical writings on Zionism have made him a polarizing figure in American political discourse, particularly during the 2008 presidential campaign when his friendship with Barack Obama became a campaign issue.

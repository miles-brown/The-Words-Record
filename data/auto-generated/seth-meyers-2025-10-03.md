### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 17 May 2021
- **Exact Wording:** *"Israel has a right to defend itself, but we should also be able to ask questions about the civilian casualties in Gaza without being accused of antisemitism. And we should be able to talk about the fact that Israel has received over $146 billion in U.S. aid since World War II, more than any other country, which gives us some standing to ask questions."*
- **Context:** During the May 2021 escalation of violence between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Meyers addressed the conflict on his late-night show during a "A Closer Look" segment. The violence had resulted in significant civilian casualties in Gaza and some casualties in Israel, sparking international debate about proportionality and U.S. aid to Israel.
- **Platform:** NBC's "Late Night with Seth Meyers" television show
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** The comments received mixed coverage, with some outlets highlighting his nuanced approach while others focused on criticism from pro-Israel groups who felt his remarks were one-sided despite acknowledging Israel's right to self-defense.
- **Categories:** Television / Politics / Foreign Policy / Middle East / Media Commentary
- **Response / Outcome:** Meyers did not issue any apology or clarification, maintaining his position that discussing U.S. aid and civilian casualties should be part of legitimate political discourse.

- **Biography:** Ernesto Henrique Fraga Araújo was born in Brasília in 1967 and pursued a career in Brazil's foreign service, joining the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1991. He earned degrees in philosophy and literature and served in various diplomatic posts including assignments in Washington D.C., Buenos Aires, and at the Vatican. Prior to his ministerial appointment, he worked as a cultural attaché and held positions within Brazil's diplomatic corps.

Araújo rose to prominence when President Jair Bolsonaro appointed him as Foreign Minister in January 2019. During his tenure, he implemented a significant shift in Brazilian foreign policy, moving away from traditional South-South cooperation and non-alignment toward closer ties with the United States and Israel under the Trump administration. He was known for his nationalist rhetoric and criticism of what he termed "globalism."

As Foreign Minister, Araújo oversaw Brazil's move of its trade office in Israel to Jerusalem and strengthened bilateral relations with Israel significantly. He frequently spoke about the importance of Brazil-Israel cooperation and shared democratic values. His tenure was marked by controversial positions on climate change and international institutions, leading to tensions with European partners and ultimately contributing to his departure from office in March 2021.

Since leaving government, Araújo has continued to write and speak on international relations and conservative political philosophy, maintaining his influence in Brazilian conservative circles and continuing to advocate for nationalist foreign policy approaches.

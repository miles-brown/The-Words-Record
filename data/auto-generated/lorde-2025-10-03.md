She began writing songs at age 9 and was discovered by a talent scout at 12. Her breakthrough came in 2013 with the release of "Royals," which became a global phenomenon and earned her two Grammy Awards at age 17, making her the youngest solo artist to win Song of the Year.

Lorde's career skyrocketed with her debut album "Pure Heroine" (2013), which showcased her unique minimalist pop sound and mature songwriting despite her young age. Her follow-up album "Melodrama" (2017) received critical acclaim and is often cited as one of the best albums of the 2010s. After a four-year hiatus, she returned with "Solar Power" in 2021, which explored themes of climate change and personal growth.

Beyond her music career, Lorde has become known for her thoughtful approach to fame and her selective public appearances. She maintains a relatively private lifestyle and is known for her intellectual approach to pop music. She has been praised for bringing alternative and indie sensibilities to mainstream pop music.

Lorde has occasionally made political statements, particularly regarding social justice issues. In 2017, she made headlines when she cancelled a scheduled concert in Tel Aviv following pressure from pro-Palestinian activists, which sparked significant controversy and debate about cultural boycotts of Israel.

I've received an overwhelming number of messages & letters and have had a lot of discussions with people holding many views, and I think the right decision at this time is to cancel the show. I pride myself on being an informed young citizen and I had done a lot of reading and sought a lot of opinions before deciding to book a show in Tel Aviv, but I'm not too proud to admit I didn't make the right call on this one. Tel Aviv, it's been a dream of mine to visit this beautiful part of the world, but I can't currently justify this to myself. I hope one day we can all dance together."*

- **Biography:** Slavoj Žižek was born in Ljubljana during the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and emerged as one of the most prominent contemporary philosophers. He studied philosophy and sociology at the University of Ljubljana, later earning his doctorate in philosophy and a second doctorate in psychoanalysis from the University of Paris VIII. His early work focused on German idealism and Lacanian psychoanalysis, establishing him as a leading figure in continental philosophy.

Žižek gained international recognition through his prolific writing, producing over 50 books that blend high theory with popular culture analysis. His works like "The Sublime Object of Ideology" (1989) and "Violence" (2008) examine contemporary political and cultural phenomena through the lens of psychoanalytic theory and Marxist critique. He has become known for his provocative speaking style, combining serious philosophical analysis with references to Hollywood films, jokes, and controversial observations.

Currently serving as International Director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities at the University of London and as a professor at various international institutions, Žižek remains one of the most cited living philosophers. His influence extends beyond academia through documentaries, media appearances, and public lectures where he critiques capitalism, liberal democracy, and contemporary ideological formations.

Žižek has courted controversy throughout his career with provocative statements on topics ranging from refugees and multiculturalism to violence and revolution. His unorthodox positions often defy simple political categorization, leading to criticism from both left and right-wing commentators while maintaining his status as an influential public intellectual.

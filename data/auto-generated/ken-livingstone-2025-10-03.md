- **Context:** Livingstone made this statement during a BBC Radio London interview while defending Labour MP Naz Shah, who had been suspended over social media posts about Israel. He was attempting to argue that criticism of Israel shouldn't be conflated with antisemitism by referencing historical connections between Nazi Germany and Zionist movements in the 1930s.
- **Platform:** BBC Radio London interview
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported the statement as highly controversial and offensive. Headlines included "Ken Livingstone suspended from Labour over Hitler comments" (BBC) and condemnation from Jewish groups and politicians across party lines. The statement was widely characterized as antisemitic and historically inaccurate.
- **Categories:** Politics / Antisemitism / Historical Claims / Radio Interview / Party Discipline
- **Response / Outcome:** Livingstone initially defended his comments, claiming they were historically accurate. He was immediately suspended from the Labour Party. Despite multiple investigations and calls for his expulsion, he continued to defend the remarks in subsequent interviews, leading to extended suspension.

She studied at the University of Toronto but dropped out to pursue journalism. Klein rose to prominence with her 2000 book "No Logo," which became a manifesto for the anti-globalization movement, critiquing corporate branding and sweatshop labor practices.

Klein's career developed through investigative journalism and activism, particularly focusing on corporate power and neoliberal economics. Her 2007 book "The Shock Doctrine" examined how political and economic elites exploit crises to implement free-market policies. She has written extensively for major publications including The Guardian, The Nation, and The New York Times, while also serving as a senior correspondent for The Intercept.

Currently, Klein continues her work as a climate activist and author, with her recent focus on environmental issues through books like "This Changes Everything" and "On Fire." She holds the Gloria Steinem Chair in Media, Culture and Feminist Studies at Rutgers University and remains one of the most prominent voices in progressive activism and anti-corporate criticism.

Klein has been notably vocal about Palestinian rights and critical of Israeli policies, drawing from her Jewish background to speak out against what she views as injustices. Her positions on Israel-Palestine have been consistent with her broader anti-colonial and human rights activism.

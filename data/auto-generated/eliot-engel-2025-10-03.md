### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 11 May 2021
- **Exact Wording:** *"Israel has a right to defend itself against these indiscriminate rocket attacks. No country should have to tolerate terrorists raining down rockets on innocent civilians.

I call on all parties to de-escalate and work toward a sustainable cease-fire that will protect innocent lives on both sides."*

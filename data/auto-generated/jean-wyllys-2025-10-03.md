He used his platform to advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and social justice issues.

In 2010, Wyllys was elected as a federal deputy for Rio de Janeiro, becoming Brazil's first openly gay congressman. During his tenure from 2011-2019, he was a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, racial equality, and progressive causes. He authored important legislation including Brazil's anti-homophobia law and consistently challenged conservative positions in Congress.

Wyllys faced significant death threats and persecution due to his activism and political positions. Following the assassination of fellow activist Marielle Franco in 2018 and escalating threats against him, he made the difficult decision to resign from Congress in early 2019 and moved to Barcelona, Spain for his safety.

From exile, he continues his activism through writing, speaking engagements, and social media advocacy. He remains an influential voice for human rights, democracy, and LGBTQ+ issues in Brazil and internationally, despite being forced to continue his work from abroad due to security concerns.

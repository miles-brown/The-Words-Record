After leaving the band in 1973, he embarked on a groundbreaking solo career that would establish him as one of the most influential figures in experimental and ambient music. His "Music for Airports" (1978) essentially created the ambient music genre.

Beyond his musical innovations, Eno became one of the most sought-after producers in rock music, working with artists like David Bowie on his Berlin Trilogy, U2 on their most acclaimed albums, and Talking Heads on their seminal works. His production techniques and conceptual approaches revolutionized studio recording practices and influenced countless musicians.

Eno has consistently used his platform to advocate for various political and social causes. He has been particularly vocal about environmental issues, war, and human rights. His artistic work often incorporates political themes, and he regularly participates in benefit concerts and campaigns for progressive causes.

Throughout his career, Eno has maintained dual identities as both an innovative artist and an outspoken political commentator, never shying away from controversial topics or using his celebrity status to promote causes he believes in.

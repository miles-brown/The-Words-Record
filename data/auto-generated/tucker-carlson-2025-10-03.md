His early career included writing for publications like The Weekly Standard and serving as a co-host on CNN's "Crossfire."

Carlson's television career flourished when he joined Fox News in 2009, eventually becoming the host of "Tucker Carlson Tonight" in 2016. The show became one of the most-watched cable news programs, known for its populist conservative messaging and criticism of immigration, liberal policies, and what Carlson termed "elite" institutions. His commentary often focused on cultural and political issues affecting working-class Americans.

Carlson's influence extended beyond television through his books and online presence. However, his tenure at Fox News ended abruptly in April 2023 following the network's settlement of the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit. He subsequently launched his own media venture and continued commentary through various platforms.

Throughout his career, Carlson has been a polarizing figure, praised by conservatives for challenging mainstream narratives while criticized by others for promoting controversial viewpoints on topics ranging from immigration to foreign policy, including his skeptical stance on U.S. support for Ukraine.

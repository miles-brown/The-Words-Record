- **Biography:** Noam Chomsky was born in Philadelphia to Hebrew scholar William Chomsky and Hebrew teacher Elsie Simonofsky. He developed an early interest in radical politics and Hebrew grammar, studying at the University of Pennsylvania where he earned his PhD in linguistics in 1955. His doctoral work laid the foundation for transformational grammar, revolutionizing the field of linguistics and establishing him as one of the most influential intellectuals of the 20th century.

Chomsky joined MIT in 1955 and spent most of his academic career there, becoming Institute Professor in 1976. His linguistic theories, particularly the concept of universal grammar and the idea that language acquisition is innate to humans, fundamentally changed how we understand human language and cognition. He has authored over 100 books on linguistics, philosophy, and politics, making him one of the most cited living scholars across multiple disciplines.

Beyond academia, Chomsky became a prominent political activist during the Vietnam War era and has remained a persistent critic of U.S. foreign policy, corporate power, and media manipulation. His political writings include "Manufacturing Consent" (with Edward Herman) and numerous books critiquing American imperialism. He describes himself as a libertarian socialist and anarcho-syndicalist, advocating for worker control of production and elimination of concentrated power structures.

Now in his 90s, Chomsky continues to write, lecture, and comment on current affairs from his home in Arizona. His influence spans linguistics, cognitive science, philosophy, and political activism, making him one of the most significant public intellectuals of our time, though his political views have often generated controversy and criticism from various quarters.

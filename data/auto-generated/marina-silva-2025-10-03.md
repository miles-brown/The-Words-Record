Silva served as a federal senator from 1995-2011 and as Environment Minister from 2003-2008 under President Lula, where she implemented strict environmental protections that significantly reduced Amazon deforestation rates. She resigned in 2008 due to conflicts over environmental policy with other government ministries. Silva has run for president three times (2010, 2014, 2018), consistently finishing third but establishing herself as Brazil's leading environmental political figure. She founded the Sustainability Network party in 2013 and continues to advocate for sustainable development, indigenous rights, and environmental protection.

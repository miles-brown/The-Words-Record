### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 4 June 2009
- **Exact Wording:** *"The aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied. Around the world, the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-Semitism in Europe culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust... On the other hand, it is also undeniable that the Palestinian people - Muslims and Christians - have suffered in pursuit of a homeland. For more than sixty years they have endured the pain of dislocation."*
- **Context:** Obama delivered his landmark "A New Beginning" speech at Cairo University in Egypt, addressing the Muslim world and attempting to reset U.S. relations with Muslim nations. The speech was part of his broader diplomatic effort to improve America's standing in the Middle East following the Bush administration. In the speech, he addressed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict directly, acknowledging both Israeli and Palestinian narratives while calling for a two-state solution.
- **Platform:** Public Speech at Cairo University
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** The speech received extensive international coverage and was generally praised for its diplomatic tone and attempt to bridge divides. Major outlets like CNN, BBC, and The New York Times highlighted Obama's balanced approach to the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Some Israeli officials expressed concerns about the equivalency drawn between Israeli and Palestinian suffering, while many in the Arab world welcomed his acknowledgment of Palestinian pain. The speech was seen as a significant shift in American diplomatic rhetoric toward the Middle East.
- **Categories:** Politics / Diplomacy / Middle East Policy / International Relations / Presidential Speech
- **Response / Outcome:** Obama continued to advocate for a two-state solution throughout his presidency. He maintained this balanced approach in subsequent speeches and policy initiatives, though relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu became strained over issues including Israeli settlements and the Iran nuclear deal.

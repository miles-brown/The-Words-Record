- **Biography:** Mike Leigh was born in Salford, Greater Manchester, to Jewish parents. He studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and later developed his distinctive filmmaking approach at drama school. His early career included work in theatre and television before transitioning to feature films. Leigh is renowned for his unique collaborative process where he works extensively with actors to develop characters and storylines through improvisation over months of rehearsal, only writing the script after this process is complete.

Throughout his career spanning over five decades, Leigh has created numerous critically acclaimed films that examine British working-class life with unflinching realism and dark humor. His notable works include "Life is Sweet" (1990), "Naked" (1993), "Secrets & Lies" (1996), "Vera Drake" (2004), and "Another Year" (2010). He has received multiple awards including the Palme d'Or at Cannes and several BAFTA awards, with frequent Oscar nominations.

Leigh's films often explore themes of social inequality, family dynamics, and the struggles of ordinary people. His work is characterized by naturalistic performances, detailed character development, and a deep empathy for his subjects, regardless of their flaws. He continues to work actively in both film and theatre, maintaining his reputation as one of Britain's most important contemporary directors.

His political views lean decidedly left-wing, and he has been vocal about social issues affecting Britain, though he typically expresses his politics through his artistic work rather than direct political activism.

- **Biography:** Dilma Vana Rousseff was born in Belo Horizonte to a Bulgarian immigrant father and Brazilian mother. During her youth, she became involved in left-wing and Marxist groups that opposed Brazil's military dictatorship. She was imprisoned and tortured by the military government in the early 1970s for her political activities and membership in armed resistance groups.

After Brazil's return to democracy, Rousseff pursued a career in economics and public administration. She served in various government positions in Rio Grande do Sul state before joining President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's federal government as Minister of Energy in 2003 and later as Chief of Staff. Her technocratic skills and loyalty to Lula made her his chosen successor for the presidency.

Rousseff was elected as Brazil's first female president in 2010 and re-elected in 2014. Her presidency was marked by economic recession, corruption scandals, and political polarization. She was impeached by Congress in 2016 on charges related to fiscal irregularities, though she maintained her innocence and called the process a "coup." After her removal from office, she remained active in international politics.

In 2023, Rousseff was appointed as President of the New Development Bank (BRICS Bank), making her the first woman and first South American to lead the institution. She continues to be a prominent voice in left-wing politics and frequently comments on international affairs, particularly regarding developing nations and South-South cooperation.

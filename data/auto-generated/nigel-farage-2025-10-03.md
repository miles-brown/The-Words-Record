- **Biography:** Nigel Paul Farage was born in Downe, Kent, and worked as a commodities trader in the City of London before entering politics. He joined UKIP in 1993 and became one of its most prominent figures, serving as party leader multiple times between 2006 and 2016. Farage was elected as a Member of the European Parliament in 1999, representing South East England, and used his position to advocate for British withdrawal from the European Union.

Farage became the face of the Leave campaign during the 2016 Brexit referendum, playing a crucial role in the narrow victory for Brexit. His populist rhetoric and media savvy made him one of the most recognizable political figures in Britain. After achieving Brexit, he founded the Brexit Party in 2019 to ensure Britain's complete departure from EU structures, later rebranding it as Reform UK.

Throughout his career, Farage has been a controversial figure, known for his provocative statements on immigration, multiculturalism, and European integration. He has faced numerous accusations of promoting divisive rhetoric, though he has consistently denied allegations of racism or extremism. He currently works as a broadcaster and political commentator while continuing to lead Reform UK.

His influence extends beyond British politics, having developed relationships with international right-wing populist movements and figures, including Donald Trump, with whom he campaigned during the 2016 US presidential election.

- **Date:** 11 May 2021
- **Exact Wording:** *"What's happening in Gaza is not defendable by any sensible person. You cannot kill children and get away with it."*
- **Context:** During escalating violence between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza in May 2021, Farage made this statement during an interview on his LBC radio show. The conflict had intensified after tensions in Jerusalem over planned evictions of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah and clashes at Al-Aqsa Mosque. Israeli airstrikes on Gaza had resulted in civilian casualties, including children, while Hamas and other militant groups fired rockets into Israel.
- **Platform:** LBC Radio Interview
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** The statement received limited coverage in mainstream British media, with some outlets noting it as an unusually direct criticism of Israel from Farage, who had generally avoided taking strong positions on Middle Eastern conflicts. Pro-Palestinian activists highlighted the comments as significant given Farage's typical focus on domestic and European issues.
- **Categories:** Politics / International Relations / Middle East Conflict / Broadcasting / Human Rights
- **Response / Outcome:** Farage did not retract or clarify the statement, maintaining his position that civilian casualties, particularly involving children, were unacceptable regardless of the political context.

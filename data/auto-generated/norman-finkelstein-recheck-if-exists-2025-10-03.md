- **Biography:** Norman Gary Finkelstein was born to Holocaust survivors in Brooklyn, New York. His parents were Polish Jews who survived the Warsaw Ghetto and Nazi concentration camps. He earned his PhD in political science from Princeton University in 1988, writing his dissertation on Zionism.

Finkelstein's academic career has been marked by controversy due to his critical stance on Israel and his arguments about Holocaust exploitation. He taught at various universities including Brooklyn College, Hunter College, and DePaul University. His 2000 book "The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering" argued that Holocaust memory has been exploited for political and financial gain, particularly to shield Israel from criticism.

His academic career faced significant challenges when he was denied tenure at DePaul University in 2007, which he attributed to pressure from pro-Israel groups. He has since worked as an independent scholar, continuing to write books and give lectures on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, often taking strongly pro-Palestinian positions.

Finkelstein remains a polarizing figure, criticized by some as crossing lines into antisemitism while defended by others as a legitimate critic of Israeli policies. He has authored numerous books on the conflict and continues to be a vocal advocate for Palestinian rights while maintaining his Jewish identity and connection to Holocaust history through his family's experience.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** June 2000
- **Exact Wording:** *"The Holocaust has proven to be an indispensable ideological weapon. Through its deployment, one of the world's most formidable military powers, with a horrendous human rights record, has cast itself as a 'victim' state, and the most successful ethnic group in the United States has likewise acquired victim status."*
- **Context:** This statement was made in Finkelstein's controversial book "The Holocaust Industry: Reflections on the Exploitation of Jewish Suffering," published in June 2000. The book argued that Holocaust memory has been systematically exploited by Israel and American Jewish organizations for political and financial purposes, particularly to deflect criticism of Israeli policies toward Palestinians.
- **Platform:** Published book
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** The book generated intense controversy with major outlets covering both criticism and defense. The New York Times, Washington Post, and other publications featured extensive debates about whether Finkelstein's arguments constituted legitimate criticism or crossed into antisemitic territory. Some praised his courage to challenge taboos while others condemned the work as harmful to Holocaust memory.
- **Categories:** Academia / Politics / Holocaust Studies / Israeli-Palestinian Conflict / Publishing
- **Response / Outcome:** Finkelstein defended his work as legitimate scholarship and criticism of policies, not antisemitism. He argued his background as the son of Holocaust survivors gave him particular insight into these issues.
- **Repercussions:**
  - Lost Employment: YES - Eventually denied tenure at DePaul University in 2007, which he attributed partly to this controversy
  - Lost Contracts: NO - Continued publishing with various publishers

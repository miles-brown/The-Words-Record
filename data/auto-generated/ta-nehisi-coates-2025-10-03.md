Coates gained national prominence with his 2014 Atlantic article "The Case for Reparations," which examined the legacy of slavery and discrimination in America. His 2015 book "Between the World and Me," written as a letter to his teenage son about the realities of being Black in America, won the National Book Award and established him as one of America's most influential voices on race. The book was adapted into a stage production and HBO special.

Throughout his career, Coates has written extensively about systemic racism, American history, and social justice. He has also written for Marvel Comics, penning runs on "Black Panther" and "Captain America." His work consistently examines how historical injustices continue to shape contemporary American society, earning him both widespread acclaim and criticism from various quarters.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 30 September 2024
- **Exact Wording:** *"I was much more comfortable, particularly after having reported this book, with the fact of Jewish ethno-nationalism than I am with the state that exists there now.

- **Context:** Coates made these comments during an interview on "CBS Mornings" to promote his book "The Message," which includes a section about his trip to Palestine and Israel.

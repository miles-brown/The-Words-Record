Peterson gained international prominence in 2016 when he publicly opposed Canada's Bill C-16, which added gender identity and gender expression to the Canadian Human Rights Act. His opposition was based on his belief that the bill would compel speech regarding pronouns. He became a bestselling author with "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos" in 2018, which sold millions of copies worldwide. Peterson has built a large following through his lectures, podcasts, and social media presence, often discussing topics related to psychology, philosophy, religion, and political correctness. He has been a controversial figure, with supporters viewing him as a defender of free speech and traditional values, while critics have accused him of promoting regressive ideologies. Peterson has faced personal struggles including severe health issues related to benzodiazepine dependence, which led him to seek treatment in Russia in 2019-2020.

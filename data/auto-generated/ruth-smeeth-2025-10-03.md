### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 30 June 2016
- **Exact Wording:** *"I was verbally attacked by a Momentum activist and Jeremy Corbyn supporter who used traditional antisemitic slurs to attack me for being part of a 'media conspiracy' along with 'the Jews'. This is beyond the pale and is the reason why we have seen a 500% increase in attacks on Jewish students on our campuses."*
- **Context:** Ruth Smeeth made this statement following an incident at the launch of the Chakrabarti Report into antisemitism in the Labour Party.

Smeeth walked out of the meeting in tears and later gave interviews describing the incident as antisemitic abuse.

- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported extensively on the incident with headlines like "Jewish Labour MP walks out of antisemitism report launch after being 'attacked'" (Telegraph) and "Labour MP Ruth Smeeth leaves antisemitism meeting in tears" (BBC). Coverage generally presented Smeeth sympathetically as a victim of antisemitic abuse, though some questioned whether the original comment was intentionally antisemitic.

### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 15 May 2021
- **Exact Wording:** *"The forced displacement of Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah is abhorrent and unacceptable. The administration should make clear to the Israeli government that these evictions are illegal and must stop immediately."*
- **Context:** During the May 2021 escalation of violence between Israel and Hamas, Warren made this statement regarding the potential eviction of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem. The evictions were part of a long-running legal dispute over property ownership, with Israeli courts ruling in favor of Jewish settlers' claims to the properties. The issue became a flashpoint that contributed to broader tensions and violence.
- **Platform:** Twitter
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Warren's statement was covered by various outlets as part of broader Democratic criticism of Israeli actions during the conflict. Conservative outlets framed it as anti-Israel, while progressive outlets praised her for speaking out. The Jerusalem Post reported on her comments alongside other Democratic senators' criticisms. Mainstream outlets like CNN and NBC included her statement in their coverage of congressional responses to the conflict.
- **Categories:** Politics / International Relations / Social Media / Human Rights / Middle East
- **Response / Outcome:** Warren did not apologize or clarify the statement. She continued to call for de-escalation and criticized both Israeli actions in Sheikh Jarrah and Hamas rocket attacks on Israeli civilians in subsequent statements.
- **Repercussions:**
  - Lost Employment: NO
  - Lost Contracts: NO
  - Painted Negatively: YES - Conservative media and pro-Israel groups criticized her statement as one-sided
  - Details: Pro-Israel organizations criticized Warren's statement as failing to acknowledge the legal complexity of the Sheikh Jarrah situation and for not sufficiently condemning Hamas violence occurring simultaneously.

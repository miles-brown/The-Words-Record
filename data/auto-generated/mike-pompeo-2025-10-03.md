### STATEMENT/INCIDENT INFORMATION:
- **Date:** 19 November 2019
- **Exact Wording:** *"The establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not per se inconsistent with international law."*
- **Context:** As Secretary of State, Pompeo announced a significant shift in U.S. policy regarding Israeli settlements in the West Bank. This reversed the Obama administration's position and the longstanding U.S. view dating back to 1978 that Israeli settlements violated international law. The announcement came during a period of heightened tensions in the region and was part of the Trump administration's broader pro-Israel policy stance.
- **Platform:** State Department press briefing and official statement
- **Media Coverage / Framing:** Major outlets reported this as a historic policy reversal. The New York Times framed it as "Trump Administration No Longer Sees Israeli Settlements as Violating International Law." CNN described it as a "major shift" in U.S. policy. International media and European officials criticized the move, while Israeli officials praised it. Palestinian officials condemned the decision as undermining peace efforts.
- **Categories:** Politics / International Relations / Middle East Policy / Diplomacy / Legal
- **Response / Outcome:** Pompeo defended the decision in subsequent interviews, stating it was based on legal analysis and that the previous policy had not advanced peace. He maintained this position throughout his tenure as Secretary of State.
- **Repercussions:**
  - Lost Employment: NO
  - Lost Contracts: NO
  - Painted Negatively: YES - Some international media and critics painted the decision negatively, though supporters praised it
  - Details: The decision was criticized by European allies, Palestinian officials, and some Democratic lawmakers, but was praised by Israeli officials and pro-Israel groups in the U.S.

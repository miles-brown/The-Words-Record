# Vercel Environment Variable Update Required

## âœ… Local Environment Updated
Your local `.env` file has been updated with SSL mode for secure database connections.

## ðŸš¨ Action Required: Update Vercel Environment Variables

To ensure your production deployment also uses SSL-encrypted database connections, you need to update your Vercel environment variables.

### Steps to Update:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Visit: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Navigate to your project: "Who-Said-What" or "The-Words-Record"

2. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Go to: Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Find and update these two variables:

   **DATABASE_URL:**
   ```
   postgresql://postgres:UXypAyfqxq4mxq1f@db.sboopxosgongujqkpbxo.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
   ```

   **DIRECT_URL:**
   ```
   postgresql://postgres:UXypAyfqxq4mxq1f@db.sboopxosgongujqkpbxo.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
   ```

3. **Redeploy**
   - After updating, trigger a new deployment to apply changes
   - Either push a new commit or use "Redeploy" button in Vercel dashboard

### What Changed?
- Added `?sslmode=require` to the end of both database URLs
- This ensures all database connections use SSL/TLS encryption
- Protects your data in transit between your application and Supabase

### Verification
After redeploying, the security audit will no longer flag "Database SSL Not Enforced" as an issue.

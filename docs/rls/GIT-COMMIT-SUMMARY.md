### Uncommitted Changes

**Modified Files** (need review):
1. `ADMIN-SETUP.md` - Admin setup documentation updates
2. `components/admin/AdminLayout.tsx` - Admin layout changes
3. `pages/admin/index.tsx` - Admin dashboard page updates
4. `pages/api/admin/dashboard.ts` - Admin API endpoint changes
5. `pages/api/auth/logout.ts` - Auth logout updates

**Deleted Files**:
1. `pages/api/auth/login.ts` - Old login API (moved to new location)
2. `pages/api/auth/me.ts` - Old me endpoint (likely refactored)
3. `scripts/jasPIZ-harvester.ts` - Harvester script (moved or renamed)

**Untracked Files** (many duplicate copies):
- Multiple `*2.tsx`, `*3.tsx` files (likely backup copies)
- New admin pages (cases, drafts, organizations, people)
- New API endpoints for admin functionality
- Various batch reports and logs

### ⚠️ Important Note: Duplicate Files

There are MANY duplicate files with `2.tsx`, `3.tsx` suffixes:
```
pages/admin/login 2.tsx
pages/admin/login 3.tsx
pages/api/organizations/[slug] 2.ts
pages/api/organizations/[slug] 3.ts
pages/cases/[slug] 2.tsx
pages/cases/[slug] 3.tsx
... and many more
```

**This suggests**:
- Someone manually copied files during development
- These are likely old backups or experiments
- They should probably be DELETED before committing
- Only the main files (without numbers) should remain

## What Needs to Be Done

### Step 1: Clean Up Duplicate Files

**Recommendation**: Delete all duplicate `*2.tsx`, `*3.tsx`, `*2.ts`, `*3.ts` files:

```bash
# Review what will be deleted first
find . -name "*2.tsx" -o -name "*3.tsx" -o -name "*2.ts" -o -name "*3.ts" | grep -v node_modules

# If the list looks correct, delete them
find . \( -name "*2.tsx" -o -name "*3.tsx" -o -name "*2.ts" -o -name "*3.ts" \) -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -delete

# Also check for duplicate directories
find . -name "*2" -type d | grep -v node_modules
```

### Step 2: Review Modified Files

Check if these modifications are intentional:

```bash
# View changes to admin files
git diff ADMIN-SETUP.md
git diff components/admin/AdminLayout.tsx
git diff pages/admin/index.tsx
git diff pages/api/admin/dashboard.ts
git diff pages/api/auth/logout.ts
```

**Questions to ask**:
- Are these changes complete and tested?
- Should they be committed?
- Or should they be discarded with `git restore <file>`?

### Step 3: Handle New Files

**New Admin Pages** (look legitimate):
```
pages/admin/cases/
pages/admin/drafts/
pages/admin/organizations/
pages/admin/people/
pages/api/admin/cases/
pages/api/admin/drafts/
pages/api/admin/organizations/
pages/api/admin/people/
pages/api/admin/users/
```

**Decision needed**: Should these be committed? If yes:
```bash
git add pages/admin/cases/
git add pages/admin/drafts/
# ... etc
```

**New Scripts** (look useful):
```
scripts/harvest-jaspiz-data.ts
scripts/jasPIZ-harvester (note: directory, not .ts file)
scripts/migrate-nationality-to-iso.ts
scripts/migrate-nationality.ts
scripts/check-nationalities.ts
```

**Decision needed**: These look like working scripts. Should be committed.

**Files to Ignore** (likely temporary):
```
data/auto-generated/batch-reports/  # Generated data
nationality-fixes.patch  # Temporary patch file
BingSiteAuth.xml  # Site verification file
```

### Step 4: Critical Missing Documentation

**IMPORTANT**: The RLS fix documentation from today's session is NOT in the git repo!

These files are in `/tmp` and need to be moved to the repo:
1. `rls-audit-report-2025-10-11.json` - RLS audit data
2. `RLS-AUDIT-SUMMARY-2025-10-11.md` - RLS analysis
3. `CRITICAL-SITE-ISSUES-DIAGNOSIS.md` - Site issues diagnosis
4. `FIX-RLS-FOR-ANONYMOUS-USERS.sql` - RLS fix SQL
5. `SUPABASE-AI-FIX-PROMPT.md` - Prompt for Supabase AI
6. `RLS-FIX-COMPLETION-REPORT.md` - Fix completion report
7. `TASK-1-JWT-VERIFICATION.sql` - JWT verification queries
8. `TASK-2-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-VERIFICATION.sql` - Service account checks
9. `TASK-3-POLICY-NAMING-STANDARDIZATION.sql` - Policy rename scripts
10. `TASK-4-AUDIT-TABLE-RETENTION.sql` - Retention cleanup scripts
11. `RLS-SECURITY-TASKS-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md` - Master execution guide

**Action needed**: Move these to a `docs/rls/` directory in the repo.

```

## Push to Remote

After commits are ready:

```bash
# Push to phase2-auth-dashboard branch
git push origin phase2-auth-dashboard
```

This will trigger Vercel deployment if your Vercel project is connected to this branch.

## Vercel Deployment

### Current Vercel Setup

Based on the branch structure:
- **main** branch → Production deployment
- **phase2-auth-dashboard** branch → Preview deployment

### After Pushing

1. Vercel will automatically detect the push
2. A new preview deployment will be created
3. Check Vercel dashboard for build status
4. Test the preview deployment URL

### To Deploy to Production

Once everything is tested on the preview deployment:

```bash
# Merge phase2-auth-dashboard into main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge phase2-auth-dashboard
git push origin main
```

This will trigger a production deployment.

## Critical RLS Fix Status

### What Was Fixed (Database Only)

✅ **Supabase AI created RLS policies** for 10 tables:
- Person, PersonNationality, Country, Case, Statement
- Organization, Tag, Source, Affiliation, StatementAuthor

✅ **Policies allow anonymous users to SELECT (read) data**

### What Still Needs Testing

⏳ **You need to verify the fix worked**:
1. Visit `/people` page → Should load
2. Visit `/cases` page → Should load
3. Check browser console → No errors

### What Needs to Be Committed

❌ **RLS documentation is NOT in git yet**:
- All RLS docs are in `/tmp`
- Need to be moved to `docs/rls/` in repo
- Need to be committed and pushed

## Summary

### Already Done ✅
- Nationality system implemented and committed
- Nationality migration completed
- RLS policies fixed in Supabase database

### Needs to Be Done ⏳
1. Clean up duplicate files
2. Add RLS documentation to repo
3. Review and commit admin changes
4. Review and commit script changes
5. Push to origin/phase2-auth-dashboard
6. Test preview deployment
7. Verify people/cases pages work
8. (Optional) Merge to main for production

### Files Modified Since Last Commit
- 5 modified files (admin-related)
- 3 deleted files (old auth endpoints)
- 50+ untracked files (many duplicates)

### Recommended Next Step

**Start with cleanup and RLS docs**:
```bash
# 1. Clean duplicates
find . \( -name "*2.tsx" -o -name "*3.tsx" -o -name "*2.ts" -o -name "*3.ts" \) -not -path "*/node_modules/*" -delete

# 2. Create docs directory
mkdir -p docs/rls

# 3. Copy RLS docs

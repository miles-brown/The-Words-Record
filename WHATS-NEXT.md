# 🚀 What's Next - Action Plan

**Created:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Project Recovered & Verified  
**Current State:** Development server running, no critical issues

---

## ✅ RECOVERY COMPLETE - Summary

### What We Did
1. ✅ Verified ALL critical files present (no code loss!)
2. ✅ Recovered 9 documentation files from iCloud backup
3. ✅ Recovered VSCode settings
4. ✅ Fixed duplicate page warnings (removed old about.tsx & methodology.tsx)
5. ✅ Fixed audit log errors (added LOGIN_FAILED & AUTHZ_DENIED enum values)
6. ✅ Confirmed current project is MORE ADVANCED than recovery backup

### What We Found
**Your current project has THESE NEW FEATURES not in the backup:**
- ✅ Complete Apps & Integrations module
- ✅ Enhanced admin forms system (9 new form components)
- ✅ Draft approval workflow
- ✅ People history tracking
- ✅ Change tracking system
- ✅ Webhook system
- ✅ Task automation system
- ✅ Health monitoring

---

## 🎯 CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

### ✅ Working Features
- Development server running on http://localhost:3000
- Admin panel functional
- Database connected (Supabase)
- Authentication working
- All admin modules (Cases, People, Organizations, Statements, Sources)
- Apps & Integrations module
- Analytics dashboard
- Audit logging

### ⚠️ Known TODOs (Low Priority)
From code inspection:
1. `/lib/auth-simple.ts` - TODO: Save to database when Prisma schema is updated
2. `/pages/people/[slug].tsx` - TODO: Re-enable affiliations when field is added back to schema
3. `/pages/api/admin/statements/search.ts` - TODO: Add authentication check
4. `/pages/api/admin/apps/integrations.ts` - TODO: Add authentication check for SuperAdmin

---

## 🔥 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES (Next 2-4 Hours)

### Priority 1: Security Hardening 🔒
**Why:** Several API endpoints missing auth checks

<function_calls>
**Tasks:**
1. Add authentication to `/api/admin/statements/search.ts`
2. Add SuperAdmin check to `/api/admin/apps/integrations.ts`
3. Review all `/api/admin/*` endpoints for auth middleware
4. Test: Try accessing admin APIs without JWT token

**Test Command:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/admin/statements/search -X POST
# Should return 401 Unauthorized, not data
```

### Priority 2: Test Admin Login Flow 🔑
**Why:** This is listed as CRITICAL in LAUNCH-TASK-LIST.md

**Tasks:**
1. Test login at `/admin/login` with valid credentials
2. Verify JWT token stored in httpOnly cookie
3. Test logout functionality
4. Test accessing `/admin` without login (should redirect)
5. Test with invalid credentials

**Command:**
```bash
npm run check-admin
# Or create test account if needed:
npm run db:seed-admin
```

### Priority 3: Clean Up Git State 📦
**Why:** We have uncommitted changes from recovery

**Tasks:**
1. Review changes: `git status`
2. Stage desired files:
   ```bash
   git add IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md PRE-LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md
   git add ADMIN_APPS_AUDIT.md API_ENDPOINTS_APPS.md TABS_NAVIGATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md
   git add PHASE_1_VALIDATION_REPORT.md LAUNCH-TASK-LIST.md APPS_MODULE_OVERVIEW.md
   git add .vscode/settings.json
   git add prisma/schema.prisma
   ```
3. Commit recovery:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "docs: Recover documentation from iCloud backup

   - Add 9 historical documentation files
   - Add VSCode SQL tools settings
   - Update schema with LOGIN_FAILED and AUTHZ_DENIED audit actions
   
   Recovered after iCloud Drive incident. All code was intact from GitHub clone."
   ```
4. Remove deleted pages:
   ```bash
   git add pages/about.tsx pages/methodology.tsx
   git commit -m "fix: Remove duplicate about and methodology pages

   - Removed pages/about.tsx (kept pages/about/index.tsx)
   - Removed pages/methodology.tsx (kept pages/methodology/index.tsx)
   - Fixes Next.js duplicate page warnings"
   ```

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Focus on Security First** - Add auth checks to all admin APIs before anything else
2. **Test Everything** - Go through the admin panel and test every feature
3. **Document Issues** - Keep a running list of bugs you find
4. **One Thing at a Time** - Don't try to do everything at once
5. **Commit Often** - Commit working changes frequently

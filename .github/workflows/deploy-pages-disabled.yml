# =========================================================================
# DISABLED: GitHub Pages workflow turned off (migrating to Vercel)
# =========================================================================
# This workflow has been disabled because:
# - Next.js + Prisma + Supabase requires server-side rendering
# - GitHub Pages only supports static content
# - Project is now deployed on Vercel with full SSR and database support
#
# To re-enable: rename this file back to deploy.yml
# =========================================================================
